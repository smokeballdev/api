# Authentication

## Client Application Details

Smokeball will provide you with your **client_id** and **client_secret** that you will use throughout the oauth2 flow.

There are two OAuth 2.0 flows used to authenticate with the API based on your integration scenario:

**[Authorization Code Grant](1-Authentication.md#1-authorization-code-grant)** - This is used to connect to the Smokeball API as an authenticated Smokeball user. The Smokeball user will authenticate using their credentials and an authorization code is passed back to your supplied redirect uri(s) which you can then exchange for an Id token.

**[Client Credentials Grant](1-Authentication.md#2-client-credentials-grant)** - This flow is used when connecting to the Smokeball API for server-to-server requests outside the context of a Smokeball user.

## 1. Authorization Code Grant

### 1.1 Request User Authorization

Direct the user to `https://datastaging-auth.smokeball.com/oauth2/authorize` with the following parameters:

Example:

```json http
{
  "method": "get",
  "url": "https://datastaging-auth.smokeball.com/oauth2/authorize",
  "query": {
    "response_type": "code",
    "client_id": "xxxxx",
    "scope": "openid",
    "redirect_uri": "https://xxxxxxxx"
  }
}
```

The user will be directed to a login page where they will need to use their Smokeball credentials to login.

If authorized, the user will be redirected to:

```html
 <https://your_redirect_uri?code=xxxxx>
```

> See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/authorization-endpoint.html> for more information.

### 1.2 Request an Id Token

Once you have obtained an authorization code, you can now use it to get an **id_token** which may be used to make requests to the API.

Make a POST request to <https://datastaging-auth.smokeball.com/oauth2/token> with the following parameters and headers:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://datastaging-auth.smokeball.com/oauth2/token",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Basic Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"    
  },
  "body": {
    "grant_type": "authorization_code",
    "client_id": "xxxx",
    "redirect_uri": "https://xxxxx",
    "code": "the code acquired from step 1"
  }
}
```

> The **Authorization** header must be the string "Basic" followed by your client_id and client_secret with a colon : in between, Base64 Encoded. For example, client_id:client_secret is Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=

**Sample Response**

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{ 
 "refresh_token":"dn43ud8uj32nk2je", 
 "id_token":"dmcxd329ujdmkemkd349r",
 "token_type":"Bearer", 
 "expires_in":3600
}
```

The returned **id_token** is valid for 60 minutes.

> ### \*\*Note
>
> The Smokeball API will _only_ accept the **id_token** and not the access_token
>
> See <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cognito/latest/developerguide/token-endpoint.html> for more information

---

### 1.3 Refreshing an Id Token

You can use the **refresh_token** returned in the previous request to continuosly retrieve a valid **id_token** for use with the API. To exchange a **refresh_token** for an **id_token**, make the following request:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://datastaging-auth.smokeball.com/oauth2/token",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Basic Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"    
  },
  "body": {
    "grant_type": "refresh_token",
    "client_id": "xxxxxx",
    "refresh_token": "xxxxxx"
  }
}
```

**Sample Response**

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
 "refresh_token":"dn43ud8uj32nk2je",
 "id_token":"dmcxd329ujdmkemkd349r",
 "token_type":"Bearer", 
 "expires_in":3600
}
```

## 2. Client Credentials Grant
The **Client Credentials** grant type is typically used for server-to-server API operations. In this scenario, you are not acting as a Smokeball user but a type of "service" that can perform operations on an Account level.

### 2.1 Request an Access Token

Make a POST request to <https://datastaging-auth.smokeball.com/oauth2/token> with the following parameters and headers:

```json http
{
  "method": "post",
  "url": "https://datastaging-auth.smokeball.com/oauth2/token",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Basic Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=",
    "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"    
  },
  "body": {
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "client_id": "xxxx"
  }
}
```

> The **Authorization** header must be the string "Basic" followed by your client_id and client_secret with a colon : in between, Base64 Encoded. For example, client_id:client_secret is Y2xpZW50X2lkOmNsaWVudF9zZWNyZXQ=

**Sample Response**

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "access_token": "dmcxd329ujdmkemkd349r...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```
